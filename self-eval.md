# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
# I felt as though these did really challenge me to think through everything we have learned on how to do each of the challenges and how to incooperate them.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# I am not good at my workflow it is hard for me to take breaks but I know it becomes an unproductive struggle if I don't.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
# I am going to continue to work on these, I think getting help from my team mates when needed was extremely helpful. Learning to ask for help is something I definitely need to work on.
